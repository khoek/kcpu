In the VM:
   * Byte versions!
   * ADD3/and friends
   * offset instructions. (we are really going to care about this once we have push and pop)

   * consider a hardware increment on RSP? Just like RIP, has to be INC BY 2!!!


Remember for designs:
  * Remember, BUS_A and BUS_B should both be pulled low.
  * WE ADDED AN INC COMMAND TO RSP. (CAN WE DEC IN ONE INST TOO??? Are there chips which do that? (unlikely?))



Bugs in current revisions:
* ALU: the high bits of the switch connecting BUS_B
       to the ALU flags register float!!!!
  ALU: It also has two floating gates!!!




Improvements future revisions:
* mod_mem: allow 1-clock word reads and writes. -> If you have this, you can't write into RA using the address in RA---so forget it?

Minor:
* mod_alu: OR and AND are swapper physically vs the mode signal numbers
