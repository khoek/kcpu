SOFT/FIRMWARE:

  VM UI:
    * Write a post-processor for the disassembler to try to collapse aliases.---this isn't super hard, just search
      for aliases which begin with the first actual opcode, and then continue checking ahead for matches.


  In the VM:
    * ENTER/LEAVE
    * offset instructions (so we can refer relative to RBP)----will this require ADD3 below?

    * FLAG-ONLY versions of the ALU insts (we already value-only versions).

    * ADD3/and friends
    * Byte versions!





HARDWARE:

  Remember for designs:
    * Remember, BUS_A and BUS_B should both be pulled low.
    * WE ADDED A HARDWARE INC COMMAND TO RSP. (CAN WE DEC IN ONE INST TOO??? Are there chips which do that? (unlikely?))


  Bugs in current revisions:
  * ALU: the high bits of the switch connecting BUS_B
        to the ALU flags register float!!!!
    ALU: It also has two floating gates!!!

  Improvements future revisions:
  * remove the zero registers from the REG module? (can we change the VM code so that we never use a pull-down behaviour?)
  * mod_alu: OR and AND are swapped physically on the board vs the mode signal numbers




  Need to think more:
  * Originally improvement thought, but then I remembered:
    mod_mem: allow 1-clock word reads and writes. -> If you have this, you can't write into RA using the address in RA---so forget it?
